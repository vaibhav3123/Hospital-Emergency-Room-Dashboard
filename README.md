### 📊 **Key Metrics**

1. **ER Visits**: 
   - Total number of patients visiting the ER: **6,219**.
   
2. **Average Wait Time**: 
   - The average time a patient waits before being seen by a healthcare professional: **21 minutes**.

3. **Average Treatment Duration**: 
   - The average time taken to treat a patient: **55 minutes**.

4. **Admission Rate**: 
   - Percentage of ER patients admitted for further treatment: **28%**.

5. **Bed Occupancy Rate**: 
   - Percentage of hospital beds occupied by ER patients: **88%**. This high rate indicates potential concerns about capacity and patient flow.

6. **Left Without Being Seen (LWBS)**: 
   - Percentage of patients who leave the ER before being treated: **1%**. A very low percentage, indicating good initial care processes.

7. **Discharge Rate**: 
   - Percentage of ER patients discharged after treatment: **72%**.


### 🔍 **Key Insights**

   - **Peak Times**: The ER sees higher traffic in the **evenings** and on **weekends**, suggesting a need for more staff during these peak hours.
   
2. **Top Diagnoses**:
   - The most common reasons for ER visits include:
     - **Chest Pain**

6. **ER Resource Usage**:
   - **Bed Occupancy**: The **88% bed occupancy** rate shows that the ER might need more resources or a better system for managing patient flow to avoid overcrowding and improve efficiency.


### 🛠 **Tools and Technologies Used**

1. **Power BI**:
   - Power BI is used for building **interactive visual dashboards** that allow users to quickly access insights and track real-time ER data.

2. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**:
   - DAX is used for creating **calculated columns** and **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** to summarize data and provide actionable insights.

3. **Power Query**:
   - Power Query helps with **data transformation and cleaning**, ensuring that the data is in the right format for analysis and visualization.

4. **Excel**:
